DawaQuery readme


Project overview 

DawaQuery will be integrating with openFDA API into my frontend codebase to access and retrieve data on drug products information   approved for human use by searching prescription products i.e brand name product,generic drug products,medical gases and over the counter (OTC) drugs. The search will be by using the search box on the home page to search by ; Drug name(s), Active ingredient(s). 
For a drug name or active ingredient search:
You can type in all or part of the drug or active ingredient name.
You must enter at least three characters.
When you enter a partial-word search, Drugs@FDA searches for that string of characters (in the exact order you typed them) anywhere in a drug or active ingredient name. For example, if you enter "proz" you will retrieve a list of drugs that have that four-letter string somewhere in the brand name or somewhere in the active ingredient name:


CEFPROZIL (an active ingredient)
OXAPROZIN (an active ingredient)
PROZAC (a brand-name drug)
PROZAC WEEKLY (a brand-name drug)
